For the report,  follow the same format you used for the first programming assignment. Your report should look like a research paper with abstract, introduction (a summary of the goals and results), experimental setup, result tables and plots, and the discussion. You should include answers to following questions in your discussion of results. Please feel free to add any other important observations.


For each m, plot the average time consumed, nodes searched, and the optimal solution lengths for the 2 algorithms and the 2 heuristics. 

1. Is there a clear preference ordering among the heuristics you tested considering the number of nodes searched and the total CPU time taken to solve the problems for the two algorithms?

2. Can a small sacrifice in optimality give a large reduction in the number of nodes expanded? What about CPU time?

3. Is the time spent on evaluating the heuristic a significant fraction of the total problem-solving time for any heuristic and algorithm you tested?

4. How did you come up with your heuristic evaluation function?

5. How do the two algorithms compare in the amount of search involved and the cpu-time?
